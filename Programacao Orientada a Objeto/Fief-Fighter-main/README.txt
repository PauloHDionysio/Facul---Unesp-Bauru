Follow the steps below to run the game:
1. Execute the file "JogoServidor.java";
2. Execute the file "JogoCliente.java" twice - one for each client;
3. To control the players, use the following keys:
    A -> move left
    D -> move right
    SHIFT -> block
    ENTER -> attack

PS: the game has a collision treatment between players - for an attack to be valid,
is necessary that the players are colliding.

PS2: so the images appear correctly, make sure that they are properly loaded on
VSCode or your preferred compiler.
